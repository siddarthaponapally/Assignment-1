### 1. **Setup the Project**

- Initialize a new React project using `create-react-app` for simplicity.
- Install necessary packages like `axios` or `fetch` (for API calls) and `react-router-dom` (if navigation between pages is needed).

---

### 2. **Component Structure**

Divide the application into modular and reusable components:

- **App Component**: The main wrapper that holds all child components.
- **UserList Component**: Displays the list of users fetched from the API.
- **UserForm Component**: Handles adding and editing user details.
- **ErrorBoundary Component**: Catches errors and displays user-friendly messages.

---

### 3. **State Management**

- Use the `state` property in class components to manage data and UI updates:
    - **User Data**: Store the list of users fetched from the API.
    - **Form State**: Store the current user data for add/edit functionality.
    - **Error State**: Store any error messages to display when API requests fail.

---

### 4. **Fetching and Displaying Users**

- Use the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method to fetch the list of users from the `JSONPlaceholder` API and update the state.
- Display the users in a table or list format with "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.

---

### 5. **Adding a New User**

- Create a button labeled "Add User" that opens a form (either inline or as a modal).
- Include fields for ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Department.
- On form submission, send a `POST` request to the `/users` endpoint using `axios` or `fetch`.
- Simulate adding the user to the state list (since JSONPlaceholder doesn't persist data).

---

### 6. **Editing a User**

- When the "Edit" button is clicked for a user, populate the form fields with the userâ€™s current data.
- Use a `PUT` request to send the updated data to the `/users` endpoint.
- Update the state with the new user details after a successful response.

---

### 7. **Deleting a User**

- When the "Delete" button is clicked, send a `DELETE` request to the `/users/{id}` endpoint.
- Remove the user from the state to simulate the deletion.

---

### 8. **Error Handling**

- Use `try-catch` blocks around all API calls to handle errors.
- Update the `error` state to show a friendly message to the user in case of failures.

---

### 9. **Bonus Features**

- **Pagination or Infinite Scrolling**:
    - Implement basic pagination using state variables for the current page and number of users per page.
    - Adjust the API request to fetch users in chunks.
- **Client-side Validation**:
    - Validate form inputs (e.g., email format, required fields) before submitting the data.
- **Responsive UI**:
    - Use CSS or a library like Bootstrap to make the interface mobile-friendly.

---

### 10. **Documentation**

- Include a `README.md` file with:
    - Project setup instructions.
    - Explanation of the directory structure and components.
    - Challenges faced and potential improvements.
